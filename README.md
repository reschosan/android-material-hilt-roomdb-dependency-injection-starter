# android-material-hilt-roomdb-dependency-injection-starter
This Project is based on Android with Android-Material to get into Hilt, RoomDB, Dependency Injection, Kotlin Coroutines (LifecycleScope) etc. It was my way how I did learn the topics.

## How to install
Either Download this Project via git clone, Zip-Download or Github Desktop and simply import or open it via Android Studio - or check out via vcs plugin on Android Studio. Afterwards you can run the application on an emulator or your device.

## Note
This project is just in a very, very basic state and not ready for any production-usage.
